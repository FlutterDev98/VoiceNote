## 4. Modeling & Design

### 4.1 System Architecture
The VoiceNote follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Presentation Layer        │
│         (SwiftUI Views)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Business Logic Layer      │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Data Model
The core data model is represented by the `NoteModel` class:
